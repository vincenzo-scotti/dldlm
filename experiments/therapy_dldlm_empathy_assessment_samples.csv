test,HOPE,10,14,Therapist,"Therapist: All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.
Patient: All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized.
Therapist: Oh, yeah, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school one, too. You know, I drink too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but, you know, promise we have these rules and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.
Patient: I know that. It's bad for me. It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. Just I don't know, I feel that my friends pressured me. I don't know if I should, like, go with different friend groups. Maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure.
Patient: I don't know. Like, being in a sports team. You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group.
Therapist: Yeah, well, you're one of the leaders.
Patient: Right and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's social, so social custom in our society, so
Therapist: maybe you can start leading as a non drinker then
Patient: I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood. You know,
Therapist: you're a star player who's gonna pick on you.
Patient: I mean, it's just one. I'm just one person.

I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it. You know, I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun, your teenage years. I get that.

Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down.

Patient: Yeah, I just then recently I've just been feeling down a lot. And I can't really like snap out of it. Like sometimes if it's happened before, I can just like, get myself back on track. But recently, I've just found it really difficult to do it.
Therapist: So it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of you've been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago. And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place?
Patient: and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock like I really wasn't expecting it. And it's got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn't really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you.
Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it. So kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much and it sounds like your mom, notice that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?
Patient: I just nothing's really changed, nothing's really improved. I feel down like absence and feel distant from things and like I said, I can't stop all over.
Therapist: Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?
Patient: And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel like maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it. Like, it's just another thing that I've not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons.
Therapist: Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't auto strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.
Patient: And I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't I didn't really want to admit it, because like it's just another failure. But my mom was talking to me and, and she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in this
Therapist: So sounds like partly you're doing it then your mum because you're a bit worried that she she isn't pleased with you at the moment.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. And I think it's great that you've come here.

Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm

Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so

Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.

Therapist: Your brother Bhushan today and he's had some concerns about your mood.
Patient: I mean, he has but I don't it's kind of weird because I'm it's actually been great. It's been great. It's been great like I've I mean I used to have issues with mood but I don't anymore and now I just oh for at least you know, last couple days at least. Maybe about a week. I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I've thought awesome like I've gotten so much done. You know I do stuff at work. I do stuff at home. I went shopping. I am doing great with Like, well, kinda great with my interpersonal relationships like I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was like so proud of myself I. Well, firstly, I got a promotion. And also, so I was happy with that. But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday. So I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him. And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, so I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But so yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. Like with a nice increase, I should say. And I just, yeah, so I've been feeling awesome. Getting a lot done.
Therapist: Yeah. You feel like you're getting a lot accomplished at work at home and what types of things you
Patient: So there's a couple projects at work that I've been working on. I got all those done. And I at home I have been working on my, like unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago, but I have still had boxes sitting around and stuff. So I got that all taken care of. I'm completely unpacked. Over the weekend, I went and bought some, like home decor stuff. So it really makes the house look just like I want it to look and I'm happy with it.
Therapist: So your mood is moods up. They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.
Patient: I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. So besides I've been fine.
Therapist: So you haven't you haven't gotten any trouble at work, or at home or anything?
Patient: No, not at all. I mean, like I said, I got approached at work. My bosses are extremely happy with how productive I've been how much I'm getting done.

I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I've thought awesome like I've gotten so much done. You know I do stuff at work. I do stuff at home. I went shopping. I am doing great with Like, well, kinda great with my interpersonal relationships like I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was like so proud of myself I. Well, firstly, I got a promotion. And also, so I was happy with that. But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday. So I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him. And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, so I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But so yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. Like with a nice increase, I should say. And I just, yeah, so I've been feeling awesome. Getting a lot done.

And I at home I have been working on my, like unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago, but I have still had boxes sitting around and stuff. So I got that all taken care of. I'm completely unpacked. Over the weekend, I went and bought some, like home decor stuff. So it really makes the house look just like I want it to look and I'm happy with it.
Therapist: So your mood is moods up. They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.
Patient: I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. So besides I've been fine.
Therapist: So you haven't you haven't gotten any trouble at work, or at home or anything?

Patient: I'm just tired.
Therapist: just tired?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph. Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive. So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine. And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range. So how does that How does that feel?
Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. I didn't know I was depressed.
Therapist: But you knew something was something was wrong.
Patient: I didn't feel like myself. I haven't been feeling like myself Now.
Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.
Patient: I mean, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired. I just have no energy.
Therapist: So you sleep a lot. But even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested.
Patient: No, not at all.
Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.
Patient: No. I just have no energy. I don't want to do anything but just sleep.
Therapist: How long has that been going on?
Patient: I guess a couple months.
Therapist: Two or three months?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What else is going on?
Patient: Well, you know, I been drinking more. I mean, I drink socially. But I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep.
Therapist: And that's where its increased?
Patient: It is Because I don't usually drink that often during the week. So it's increased. Yeah.
Therapist: And I can see where that would be bothersome to you. What else? What else is going on with you?
Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago. So Mother's Day is coming up so you don't have to think about mama law. I miss her a lot.
Therapist: And anniversaries is close?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: That's particularly hard. When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. that's a that's a very difficult time.
Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: Exercises is again in a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.
Patient: Okay. I didn't know that.
Therapist: Yeah, it actually raises serotonin You heard about serotonin.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Happy hormone. Yes. So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is, but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself. So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly in and actually improving the quality of sleep. How does that sound at this point?
Patient: Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to be on the medication Right now we can try that.
Therapist: Absolutely. Again, those are yours, your decisions and I'm, I'm here to really support you in those if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm, I'm all for it.
Patient: I'll try them on the medication. I have some friends exercise and workout I could probably call and exercise with them.
Therapist: So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program? Yeah. Is this something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?
Patient: Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym. I have some friends that walk after work.
Therapist: So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Which of those tend to interest you most?
Patient: Well, and then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes, too. So, yeah, but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it, but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away.
Therapist: Very good. Well, I think it sounds like this is an important for you to feel better. And it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan. How do you see this fitting into your Life at this pointagain, kind of getting back to the counseling and, and the exercise.
Patient: Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work. So I can call her and see if I could still see her after work for therapy, and exercise. And I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends, my friends, they exercise various time. So, yeah.
Therapist: Let's talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program. Zero being not very competent at all and 10 being very confident. Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.
Patient: Honestly, maybe five and I'll try it. Anything if if I have to do that, so I have to go on medication, then I'll try it. Okay.
Therapist: That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.
Patient: Yes, I'll try it.
Therapist: Okay. And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point, then.
Patient: Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but you know, I'm just sleeping all the time. So when they call I'm sleep, so I haven't really call them back. But I, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know, I'll want to meet up with them. And, you know, at least maybe just start walking.
Therapist: I think that's a great decision. You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call.
Patient: Yeah, have real close, close friends that lives not too far from me. Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise.
Patient: Well, I probably shouldn't come home. I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Well, I probably shouldn't come home. I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her.",Therapist: So it would be difficult to do it in the morning. You don't see that happening,Ground truth
test,HOPE,12,90,Therapist,"Therapist: Hi. Alvina, how are you doing today? It's good to see you?
Patient: I'm just tired.
Therapist: just tired?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph. Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive. So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine. And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range. So how does that How does that feel?
Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. I didn't know I was depressed.
Therapist: But you knew something was something was wrong.
Patient: I didn't feel like myself. I haven't been feeling like myself Now.
Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.
Patient: I mean, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired. I just have no energy.
Therapist: So you sleep a lot. But even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested.
Patient: No, not at all.
Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.
Patient: No. I just have no energy. I don't want to do anything but just sleep.
Therapist: How long has that been going on?
Patient: I guess a couple months.
Therapist: Two or three months?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What else is going on?
Patient: Well, you know, I been drinking more. I mean, I drink socially. But I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep.
Therapist: And that's where its increased?
Patient: It is Because I don't usually drink that often during the week. So it's increased. Yeah.
Therapist: And I can see where that would be bothersome to you. What else? What else is going on with you?
Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago. So Mother's Day is coming up so you don't have to think about mama law. I miss her a lot.
Therapist: And anniversaries is close?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: That's particularly hard. When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. that's a that's a very difficult time.
Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: Exercises is again in a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.
Patient: Okay. I didn't know that.
Therapist: Yeah, it actually raises serotonin You heard about serotonin.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Happy hormone. Yes. So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is, but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself. So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly in and actually improving the quality of sleep. How does that sound at this point?
Patient: Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to be on the medication Right now we can try that.
Therapist: Absolutely. Again, those are yours, your decisions and I'm, I'm here to really support you in those if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm, I'm all for it.
Patient: I'll try them on the medication. I have some friends exercise and workout I could probably call and exercise with them.
Therapist: So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program? Yeah. Is this something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?
Patient: Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym. I have some friends that walk after work.
Therapist: So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Which of those tend to interest you most?
Patient: Well, and then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes, too. So, yeah, but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it, but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away.
Therapist: Very good. Well, I think it sounds like this is an important for you to feel better. And it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan. How do you see this fitting into your Life at this pointagain, kind of getting back to the counseling and, and the exercise.
Patient: Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work. So I can call her and see if I could still see her after work for therapy, and exercise. And I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends, my friends, they exercise various time. So, yeah.
Therapist: Let's talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program. Zero being not very competent at all and 10 being very confident. Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.
Patient: Honestly, maybe five and I'll try it. Anything if if I have to do that, so I have to go on medication, then I'll try it. Okay.
Therapist: That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.
Patient: Yes, I'll try it.
Therapist: Okay. And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point, then.
Patient: Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but you know, I'm just sleeping all the time. So when they call I'm sleep, so I haven't really call them back. But I, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know, I'll want to meet up with them. And, you know, at least maybe just start walking.
Therapist: I think that's a great decision. You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call.
Patient: Yeah, have real close, close friends that lives not too far from me. Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise.

So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.
Patient: All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized.
Therapist: Oh, yeah, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school one, too. You know, I drink too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but, you know, promise we have these rules and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.
Patient: I know that. It's bad for me. It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. Just I don't know, I feel that my friends pressured me. I don't know if I should, like, go with different friend groups. Maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure.
Patient: I don't know. Like, being in a sports team. You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group.
Therapist: Yeah, well, you're one of the leaders.
Patient: Right and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's social, so social custom in our society, so
Therapist: maybe you can start leading as a non drinker then
Patient: I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood. You know,
Therapist: you're a star player who's gonna pick on you.
Patient: I mean, it's just one. I'm just one person.
Therapist: All right.
Patient: Well, supermom.
Therapist: Yeah. So the issue again, is, I can't be hearing reports about your drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it. You know, I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun, your teenage years. I get that. But you know, you are start player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this.
Patient: Okay. Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party and like, no, not not not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent. And, like have it publicized on the internet.

Patient: I know that. It's bad for me. It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. Just I don't know, I feel that my friends pressured me. I don't know if I should, like, go with different friend groups. Maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure.
Patient: I don't know. Like, being in a sports team. You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group.
Therapist: Yeah, well, you're one of the leaders.
Patient: Right and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's social, so social custom in our society, so
Therapist: maybe you can start leading as a non drinker then
Patient: I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood. You know,
Therapist: you're a star player who's gonna pick on you.
Patient: I mean, it's just one. I'm just one person.
Therapist: All right.
Patient: Well, supermom.
Therapist: Yeah. So the issue again, is, I can't be hearing reports about your drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it. You know, I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun, your teenage years. I get that. But you know, you are start player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this.
Patient: Okay. Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party and like, no, not not not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent. And, like have it publicized on the internet.

So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.
Patient: All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized.

Patient: Um, my thoughts are like, I'm in the car. I'm gonna get hit. If I'm taking a test, it's like, Okay, I gotta do well on this test. I gotta remember this, there's so much to remember, and I just kind of brings freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. So I guess. So have you found that? No problem, which was not being able to complete the task?
Therapist: Four is it worth once you go through?
Patient: Um, is it like anxiety over when I finished the test? Yeah, yeah, after I'm finished. I mean, I know I could do perform better if I was going because I knew it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. Um, it seems to me like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, maybe it's over. You know, I'm anxious during it but when it's over. Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down.
Therapist: So sounds like you might need to find something that helps.
Patient: Yeah, I also think that the time, tell me in the moment because these are things that I mean, I can't avoid. I mean, even in my job to I've got to go my field placement. I've got to do these group settings, you know, I've got to do, and kids are crazy. They're disrespectful, like, Okay, I got to do it, though. So all these things I have to do. I can't change them and my wife right now, so got to figure out how to deal with it better.
Therapist: Would you like to describe that?
Patient: yeah, I'm very eager to learn something that can make a difference.
Therapist: Well, there's something called grounding do you know?
Patient: No just lectricity grounding, you know that third floor thing, that's only grounding I know. I need to be grounded. That sounds good. Bring it on
Therapist: So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place. So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem like there's still traffic. Yeah, nothing's going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal with
Patient: That sounds good.
Therapist: So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses. Okay, so I have a little script. Okay

Patient: I am all right,
Therapist: you, all right ?
Patient: Yeah. There's been some changes in my life but um, yeah.
Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient: I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore.
Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: You don't know ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient: Yes. Yes.
Therapist: Like, markedly so.
Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,
Therapist: if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.
Therapist: Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient: Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.
Therapist: What's your responsibility right now?
Patient: Nothing. Nothing. I mean,
Therapist: So no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die.
Patient: I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No.
Therapist: So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ?
Patient: I used to
Therapist: how about now ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: What happened to your goals?
Patient: I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm just so far gone like my life is so ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like
Therapist: how to redeem yourself.
Patient: Mm hmm
Therapist: you can't see what to do that now.
Patient: No.
Therapist: I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you.
Patient: I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's just at this point. It's like I've lost so much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything.
Therapist: You don't have anything you don't have any worth. worthless. That's how you're feeling ?
Patient: Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, like nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon.
Therapist: and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: why is that ?
Patient: I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel like you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.
Therapist: hmmm
Patient: And I feel like at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I just Oh,
Therapist: you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Can you tell me about the plan?
Patient: I don't really want to talk about it.
Therapist: But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan?
Patient: No, no, obviously not.
Therapist: But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan.
Patient: I get I guess so.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you just I mean, it sounds like you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient . You recall those conversations ?
Patient: I guess.
Therapist: But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: And you don't want me to stop here?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. Right feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems like the only option right now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you?
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Are you disappointed? I'm trying to save your life.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Do you understand why I'm doing it.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: ...",Patient: Yeah.,Therapist: All right. So I'm gonna walk you over 20 other counselors. I gotta make some phone calls. We'll get you over there. Okay. All right.,Ground truth

Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient: I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore.
Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: You don't know ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient: Yes. Yes.
Therapist: Like, markedly so.
Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,
Therapist: if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.
Therapist: Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient: Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.
Therapist: What's your responsibility right now?
Patient: Nothing. Nothing. I mean,
Therapist: So no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die.
Patient: I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No.
Therapist: So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ?
Patient: I used to
Therapist: how about now ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: What happened to your goals?
Patient: I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm just so far gone like my life is so ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like
Therapist: how to redeem yourself.
Patient: Mm hmm
Therapist: you can't see what to do that now.
Patient: No.
Therapist: I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you.
Patient: I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's just at this point. It's like I've lost so much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything.
Therapist: You don't have anything you don't have any worth. worthless. That's how you're feeling ?
Patient: Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, like nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon.
Therapist: and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: why is that ?
Patient: I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel like you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.
Therapist: hmmm
Patient: And I feel like at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I just Oh,
Therapist: you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Can you tell me about the plan?
Patient: I don't really want to talk about it.
Therapist: But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan?
Patient: No, no, obviously not.
Therapist: But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan.
Patient: I get I guess so.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you just I mean, it sounds like you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient . You recall those conversations ?
Patient: I guess.
Therapist: But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: And you don't want me to stop here?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. Right feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems like the only option right now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you?
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Are you disappointed? I'm trying to save your life.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Do you understand why I'm doing it.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: ...",Patient: Yeah.,Therapist: I feel like I've been drowning in the pool of your emotions. And your mind has been trying to swim against you. And I'm just gonna have to pull out of the pool and get to the outside.,DLDLM

Patient: I am all right,

Patient: Yeah. There's been some changes in my life but um, yeah.
Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.

test,HOPE,8,42,Therapist,"Therapist: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Patient: Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist: Hmm umm
Patient: Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist: Ahmm
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: Alright.
Patient: So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist: Uhh hmm
Patient: So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence
Patient: right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist: Ahhh hmmm.
Patient: Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.
Therapist: It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
Patient: I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.
Therapist: So, it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed.
Patient: Exactly.
Therapist: Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing so well in school, maybe any other things ?
Patient: Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So that that's also changed.
Therapist: So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now
Patient: a little bit because not all of them are into that. So like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist: hmm hmm.
Patient: So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.
Therapist: Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Patient: Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.
Therapist: Yeah
Patient: I understand that. situations like this will happen. It's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.
Therapist: Umm
Patient: That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing.
Therapist: Your mom is really important to you ?
Patient: of course,
Therapist: how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit?
Patient: I'm pretty confident
Therapist: especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?
Patient: probably like an eight or nine I'm I can't be in time because nothing's attend my field. There's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to
Therapist: Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Patient: Because I don't know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.
Therapist: Umm hmm
Patient: It's not a pleasant experience. It's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like, even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens. Like all the fun that I have, then prior to that, just it's not worth it's not worth drinking.
Therapist: Right? What do you think's a realistic goal for you then?
Patient: To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.
Therapist: ...","Patient: To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.",Therapist: Okay,Ground truth
test,HOPE,8,42,Therapist,"Therapist: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Patient: Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist: Hmm umm
Patient: Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist: Ahmm
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: Alright.
Patient: So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist: Uhh hmm
Patient: So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence

Therapist: Okay,
Patient: so it like came down a little bit
Therapist: what were you thinking at that point?
Patient: Well I thought a couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.
Therapist: So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?
Patient: on my leg.
Therapist: How many times ?
Patient: three
Therapist: How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?
Patient: No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.
Therapist: But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?
Patient: Like a three
Therapist: three, what were you thinking right afterwards?
Patient: That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.
Therapist: Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?
Patient: The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did
Therapist: Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?
Patient: Well, I kind of forgot about it.
Therapist: Okay.
Patient: But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.
Therapist: I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.
Patient: No. That always seems to happen.
Therapist: Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?
Patient: Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist: I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.
Patient: I've been doing pretty good
Therapist: you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?
Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.
Therapist: Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.
Patient: Yeah, cuz she's stupid.
Therapist: Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?
Patient: Yeah. That's right.
Therapist: So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.
Patient: Okay
Therapist: that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.
Patient: It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though. I'll tell you that much.
Therapist: It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.
Patient: All right

Therapist: What was going on at your locker?
Patient: Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim. My boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted to punch her so bad.

Therapist: What did you do right then? You ride your locker. What's the next thing you did after you heard it?
Patient: The next thing I did, I slammed my locker. And I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her adn punch her.
Therapist: So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, so we're between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym. Where did you decide to cut? Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. There must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut.
Patient: I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to go cut.
Therapist: Okay, so that was when you decided to cut. You went down to the gym.
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: And what happened when you got there?
Patient: Well, nobody was there because gym classes are in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym. So I went behind the bleachers.
Therapist: What did you use to cut ?
Patient: the pencil that I have always used
Therapist: the same pencil as usual?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: the the metal tip.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.
Patient: Yeah, I know. It's just it's it's my favorite pencil. I, I use it for school. And I just it's my favorite pencil.
Therapist: Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers. You say you were feeling angry still. Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers.
Patient: I was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I knew I was gonna cut
Therapist: Okay,
Patient: so it like came down a little bit
Therapist: what were you thinking at that point?
Patient: Well I thought a couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.
Therapist: So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?
Patient: on my leg.
Therapist: How many times ?
Patient: three
Therapist: How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?
Patient: No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.
Therapist: But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?
Patient: Like a three
Therapist: three, what were you thinking right afterwards?
Patient: That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.
Therapist: Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?
Patient: The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did
Therapist: Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?
Patient: Well, I kind of forgot about it.
Therapist: Okay.
Patient: But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.
Therapist: I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.
Patient: No. That always seems to happen.
Therapist: Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?
Patient: Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist: I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.
Patient: I've been doing pretty good
Therapist: you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?

Patient: I am all right,
Therapist: you, all right ?
Patient: Yeah. There's been some changes in my life but um, yeah.
Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient: I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore.
Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: You don't know ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient: Yes. Yes.
Therapist: Like, markedly so.
Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,
Therapist: if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.
Therapist: Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient: Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.
Therapist: What's your responsibility right now?
Patient: Nothing. Nothing. I mean,
Therapist: So no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die.
Patient: I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No.
Therapist: So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ?
Patient: I used to
Therapist: how about now ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: What happened to your goals?
Patient: I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm just so far gone like my life is so ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like
Therapist: how to redeem yourself.
Patient: Mm hmm
Therapist: you can't see what to do that now.
Patient: No.
Therapist: I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you.
Patient: I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's just at this point. It's like I've lost so much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything.
Therapist: You don't have anything you don't have any worth. worthless. That's how you're feeling ?
Patient: Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, like nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon.
Therapist: and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: why is that ?
Patient: I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel like you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.
Therapist: hmmm
Patient: And I feel like at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I just Oh,
Therapist: you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Can you tell me about the plan?
Patient: I don't really want to talk about it.
Therapist: But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan?
Patient: No, no, obviously not.
Therapist: But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan.
Patient: I get I guess so.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you just I mean, it sounds like you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient . You recall those conversations ?
Patient: I guess.
Therapist: But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: And you don't want me to stop here?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. Right feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems like the only option right now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you?
Patient: I mean, I guess.

Patient: Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, like nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon.
Therapist: and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: why is that ?
Patient: I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel like you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.
Therapist: hmmm
Patient: And I feel like at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I just Oh,
Therapist: you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Can you tell me about the plan?
Patient: I don't really want to talk about it.
Therapist: But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan?
Patient: No, no, obviously not.
Therapist: But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan.
Patient: I get I guess so.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you just I mean, it sounds like you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient . You recall those conversations ?
Patient: I guess.
Therapist: But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: And you don't want me to stop here?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. Right feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ?
Patient: Yes
Therapist: I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems like the only option right now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you?

test,HOPE,0,146,Therapist,"Therapist: Hi Angela, how are you doing today ?
Patient: I am all right,
Therapist: you, all right ?
Patient: Yeah. There's been some changes in my life but um, yeah.
Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient: I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore.
Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: You don't know ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient: Yes. Yes.
Therapist: Like, markedly so.
Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,
Therapist: if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.
Therapist: Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient: Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.
Therapist: What's your responsibility right now?
Patient: Nothing. Nothing. I mean,
Therapist: So no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die.
Patient: I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No.
Therapist: So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ?
Patient: I used to
Therapist: how about now ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: What happened to your goals?
Patient: I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm just so far gone like my life is so ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like
Therapist: how to redeem yourself.
Patient: Mm hmm
Therapist: you can't see what to do that now.
Patient: No.
Therapist: I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you.
Patient: I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's just at this point. It's like I've lost so much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything.

Patient: Yeah, I'm, I'm recently married. And so my husband and I moved in together. And up until then I I've lived by myself. My whole adult life.

Therapist: so you're with people when you still feel isolated.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you are with people when you're not feeling isolated, how would you characterize the quality of the relationships you have? Let's start with your family. How good do you think those relationships are?
Patient: I mean, they're okay. Like not really that great. But everybody has like, trouble with their family. I guess so. I don't know.
Therapist: You think its more or less normal?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: How is it with your friends?
Patient: It's okay. You know, I guess I'm always like, second guessing everything. Like, do they really like me? Do they really want to spend time with me? I know I'm bothering them. That kind of thing. But I mean, it's not for the most part. I mean, I think they care about me. It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time. I think When we're together for the most part but
Therapist: most part positive ?
Patient: yeah
Therapist: Do you have any conflict or crisis going on right now? You mentioned the loss of your job.

I just don't know what to do. I'm feeling really lost and like helpless and like everything's just pointless.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. When are you going to be evicted?

Therapist: So then month are going to be evicted from the is it house or apartment ?
Patient: Its an apartment
Therapist: when did you find this out?
Patient: Um, well, you know, before I lost my job, I had some trouble paying the rent as it was. So, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like, a month and a half ago, my landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore, but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in Then and Now, at the beginning of the month, he said, you know, you have to, you're gonna have to get out of here, you're gonna be evicted. We're gonna change the locks. And
Therapist: so it's all fairly recent.
Patient: Yeah. I guess that's why having more anxiety than before because like, it feels really out of control, and I don't know what is going to happen like when he's going to do it, you know, for sure and how you know what I'm going to do. So
Therapist: there's a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen and what's going to happen to you?
Patient: Exactly
Therapist: hmmm.. . have you in the past thought about suicide?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: Can you tell me about how many times or about how often ?

Therapist: so you're with people when you still feel isolated.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you are with people when you're not feeling isolated, how would you characterize the quality of the relationships you have? Let's start with your family. How good do you think those relationships are?

Therapist: You think its more or less normal?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: How is it with your friends?
Patient: It's okay. You know, I guess I'm always like, second guessing everything. Like, do they really like me? Do they really want to spend time with me? I know I'm bothering them. That kind of thing. But I mean, it's not for the most part. I mean, I think they care about me. It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time. I think When we're together for the most part but
Therapist: most part positive ?
Patient: yeah
Therapist: Do you have any conflict or crisis going on right now? You mentioned the loss of your job.
Patient: Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna be evicted from my house or you know, my apartment because I can't pay my bills because I lost my job so I really don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to go. I just don't know what to do. I'm feeling really lost and like helpless and like everything's just pointless.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. When are you going to be evicted?
Patient: Um, well, I'm not quite sure. Um, it sounds like it's going to be at the end of the month.
Therapist: So then month are going to be evicted from the is it house or apartment ?
Patient: Its an apartment
Therapist: when did you find this out?
Patient: Um, well, you know, before I lost my job, I had some trouble paying the rent as it was. So, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like, a month and a half ago, my landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore, but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in Then and Now, at the beginning of the month, he said, you know, you have to, you're gonna have to get out of here, you're gonna be evicted. We're gonna change the locks. And
Therapist: so it's all fairly recent.
Patient: Yeah. I guess that's why having more anxiety than before because like, it feels really out of control, and I don't know what is going to happen like when he's going to do it, you know, for sure and how you know what I'm going to do. So
Therapist: there's a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen and what's going to happen to you?
Patient: Exactly
Therapist: hmmm.. . have you in the past thought about suicide?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: Can you tell me about how many times or about how often ?
Patient: Umm probably like, every time I get depressed like this, I, I, you know, have those thoughts. So I don't know. I mean, how often? That's that's a really hard question.
Therapist: All right. Have you ever attempted to commit suicide?
Patient: Yeah, one time, probably like four years ago.
Therapist: What did you do?
Patient: I cut my wrists, but it wasn't, you know, nothing really happened. Like I just put a I just wrapped him up. It wasn't really that bad
Therapist: You didn't need to go to hospital
Patient: No
Therapist: Have you ever thought about committing suicide and we're about to attempt and stopped ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: How many times does that happen?

Therapist: So once or twice in the recent past ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Have you ever injured yourself intentionally?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, can you tell me about that.
Patient: Well, there was that time that I tried to commit suicide and then there have been times before that where I like, you know, kind of like tested the waters like, you know, just cut myself a little bit to see what it would be like and that kind of thing.
Therapist: was the last time You have done that ?
Patient: Um, it would be the last time I tried to commit suicide like that with time I was telling you about that really freaked me out. So I don't think I would try that again.
Therapist: so you don't think you'd try that again.
Patient: No Not like cutting myself up.
Therapist: Okay. Have you ever been abused, physically, sexually, emotionally?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: So if you get evicted, you're worried you'd have to live with your mother.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: And you guys had a rough time in the past.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: You don't want to repeat that.
Patient: No, I don't wanna live like that
Therapist: What is your attitude towards suicide? What are your feelings about suicide as a concept in general?
Patient: I don't know. I mean, I guess it's really sad like, nobody wants that. You know, whenever you hear somebody committed suicide, everybody's really sad about it, but sometimes it just feels like what else is there? You know, like, I don't know how I can go on like this, like things just keep getting worse and worse. And I don't know what to do. So I mean, I'm sure. Like, it's not a great thing, but at the same time, I don't know.
Therapist: You disapprove it, But you're considering it because you're running out of options.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: Have you ever been impulsive in the past?
Patient: Um, I don't know. Like, I guess not really. Because there have been times when I've like thought about committing suicide and getting really close and still haven't done it. You know,
Therapist: Do you have other areas other than suicide. Generally impulsive
Patient: I don't think so.
Therapist: Ever violent or aggressive?
Patient: Not really, no, no.
Therapist: Have you ever experienced a couple loose nations, which should be like hearing things other people can't hear seeing things that people can't see.
Patient: I don't think so. I
Therapist: You don't think so.
Patient: No, I mean, it's hard to tell what other people can't hear when no one's around to tell you whether they can hear it or not. But I don't think that I have
Therapist: to be fairly certain, you know that?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Can you tell me about any alcohol or drug use?
Patient: Sometimes I drink, you know, alone when I'm in my house, because like I said, I don't see a lot of other people. I don't really do any drugs.
Therapist: When's the last time you had a drink?
Patient: Last night
Therapist: How much did you had ?
Patient: Probably like a bottle of wine.

Patient: fairly intense, Like it's scary the thought of it, you know, but at the same time, like, I'm having them so much it's, I don't know.
Therapist: It's frightening for you.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Do you have a plan laid out if you're trying to commit suicide?
Patient: I guess I would just drink a bottle of wine like I usually do and then maybe take some pills.
Therapist: What kind of pills ?
Patient: um, there's like ibuprofen in my medicine cabinet. That's like the only thing I have in there other than vitamin. So I guess I just take that. I don't know how many. 4 I guess I dont know.
Therapist: So you would drink a bottle of wine and take a lot of ibuprofen ?
Patient: Hmm mmm
Therapist: Do you have an intent to commit suicide? You're gonna you're gonna fall through ?
Patient: I don't know like sometimes I think about it I get really close to doing it, but I you know, I haven't like taken any pill so I guess yeah, like I think about it a lot and I've gotten close to doing it so yeah, I guess Yeah, I guess so
Therapist: Do you feel like you have an intent ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: Can you tell me about some of the reasons for staying alive for not committing suicide?
Patient: Well, I don't really want to die. Um, I guess my friend family would be really upset and I probably my friends, too. I don't know.

Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient: Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just
Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: ...",Patient: Yeah.,"Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly.

You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.

Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.

Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.

Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly

Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah

And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,

Now, sometimes what can happen is that the time So down here in this area that can actually stop the airflow here. So what happens during this reaction to try and get oxygen in? Okay? For this, I would like to run a couple tests to do bottom of it. I will be advising you to go for a sleep study. And I can measure how well you're sleeping and delineates what's happening, what's causing the snoring. Your heart sounds sound good.

So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.
Therapist: Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient: Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time
Therapist: this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.
Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist: So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient: Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient: Well, I think
Patient: over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient: punched in the gut.
Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient: I'd be able to do that I
Patient: think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of
Patient: talking with her.
Patient: maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,
Patient: and then go from there.
Therapist: So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.
Patient: Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.
Therapist: You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week?
Patient: I will definitely try.
Therapist: ...",Patient: I will definitely try.,"Therapist: So really our plan move forward as a couple parts. So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?",Ground truth
test,HOPE,38,73,Therapist,"Therapist: Alisa How you doing today?
Patient: Good? How are you?
Therapist: I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist: How has the anxiety been going?
Patient: Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.
Patient: Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think
Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient: Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just
Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.
Therapist: Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient: Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time
Therapist: this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.
Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist: So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient: Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient: Well, I think
Patient: over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient: punched in the gut.
Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient: I'd be able to do that I
Patient: think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of

Patient: Yep.
Therapist: Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit. When what day did that happen on?
Patient: Tuesday
Therapist: Tuesday? Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut?
Patient: Where I usually always am at school. I was on my Walker. That's stupid girl.
Therapist: What was going on at your locker?
Patient: Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim. My boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted to punch her so bad.
Therapist: Okay, so you were sending out your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear.
Patient: Yeah, she was talking about him. And he had he didn't text me the night before. So who knows what's going on?
Therapist: What were you feeling right then?
Patient: so angry. so angry
Therapist: on a scale of one to 10 how angry would you say you were ?
Patient: like a nine
Therapist: pretty angry then?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What did you do right then? You ride your locker. What's the next thing you did after you heard it?
Patient: The next thing I did, I slammed my locker. And I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her adn punch her.
Therapist: So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, so we're between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym. Where did you decide to cut? Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. There must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut.
Patient: I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to go cut.
Therapist: Okay, so that was when you decided to cut. You went down to the gym.
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: And what happened when you got there?
Patient: Well, nobody was there because gym classes are in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym. So I went behind the bleachers.
Therapist: What did you use to cut ?
Patient: the pencil that I have always used
Therapist: the same pencil as usual?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: the the metal tip.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.
Patient: Yeah, I know. It's just it's it's my favorite pencil. I, I use it for school. And I just it's my favorite pencil.
Therapist: Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers. You say you were feeling angry still. Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers.
Patient: I was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I knew I was gonna cut
Therapist: Okay,
Patient: so it like came down a little bit
Therapist: what were you thinking at that point?
Patient: Well I thought a couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.
Therapist: So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?
Patient: on my leg.
Therapist: How many times ?
Patient: three
Therapist: How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?
Patient: No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.
Therapist: But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?
Patient: Like a three
Therapist: three, what were you thinking right afterwards?
Patient: That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.
Therapist: Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?
Patient: The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did
Therapist: Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?
Patient: Well, I kind of forgot about it.
Therapist: Okay.
Patient: But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.
Therapist: I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.
Patient: No. That always seems to happen.
Therapist: Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?
Patient: Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist: I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.
Patient: I've been doing pretty good
Therapist: you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?
Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.
Therapist: Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.
Patient: Yeah, cuz she's stupid.
Therapist: Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?
Patient: Yeah. That's right.
Therapist: So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.
Patient: Okay

Therapist: So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.
Patient: Okay
Therapist: ...",Patient: Okay,Therapist: One thing that you can do instead is just to leave the room and not come back in for a few minutes.,DLDLM
test,HOPE,25,76,Therapist,"Therapist: Okay, so I noticed on your diary card that you have that you did cut.
Patient: Yep.
Therapist: Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit. When what day did that happen on?
Patient: Tuesday
Therapist: Tuesday? Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut?
Patient: Where I usually always am at school. I was on my Walker. That's stupid girl.
Therapist: What was going on at your locker?
Patient: Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim. My boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted to punch her so bad.
Therapist: Okay, so you were sending out your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear.
Patient: Yeah, she was talking about him. And he had he didn't text me the night before. So who knows what's going on?
Therapist: What were you feeling right then?
Patient: so angry. so angry
Therapist: on a scale of one to 10 how angry would you say you were ?
Patient: like a nine
Therapist: pretty angry then?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What did you do right then? You ride your locker. What's the next thing you did after you heard it?
Patient: The next thing I did, I slammed my locker. And I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her adn punch her.
Therapist: So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, so we're between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym. Where did you decide to cut? Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. There must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut.
Patient: I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to go cut.
Therapist: Okay, so that was when you decided to cut. You went down to the gym.
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: And what happened when you got there?
Patient: Well, nobody was there because gym classes are in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym. So I went behind the bleachers.
Therapist: What did you use to cut ?
Patient: the pencil that I have always used
Therapist: the same pencil as usual?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: the the metal tip.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.
Patient: Yeah, I know. It's just it's it's my favorite pencil. I, I use it for school. And I just it's my favorite pencil.
Therapist: Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers. You say you were feeling angry still. Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers.
Patient: I was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I knew I was gonna cut
Therapist: Okay,
Patient: so it like came down a little bit
Therapist: what were you thinking at that point?
Patient: Well I thought a couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.
Therapist: So you have your pencil Where did you cut ?
Patient: on my leg.
Therapist: How many times ?
Patient: three
Therapist: How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?
Patient: No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.
Therapist: But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?
Patient: Like a three
Therapist: three, what were you thinking right afterwards?
Patient: That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.
Therapist: Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?
Patient: The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did
Therapist: Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?
Patient: Well, I kind of forgot about it.
Therapist: Okay.
Patient: But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.
Therapist: I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.
Patient: No. That always seems to happen.
Therapist: Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?
Patient: Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist: I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.
Patient: I've been doing pretty good
Therapist: you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?
Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.
Therapist: Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.
Patient: Yeah, cuz she's stupid.
Therapist: Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?
Patient: Yeah. That's right.
Therapist: So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.
Patient: Okay
Therapist: ...",Patient: Okay,Therapist: I think you're going to want to try something else. I don't think it's gonna work.,Therapy-DLDLM
test,HOPE,12,96,Therapist,"Therapist: Hi. Alvina, how are you doing today? It's good to see you?
Patient: I'm just tired.
Therapist: just tired?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph. Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive. So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine. And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range. So how does that How does that feel?
Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. I didn't know I was depressed.
Therapist: But you knew something was something was wrong.
Patient: I didn't feel like myself. I haven't been feeling like myself Now.
Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.
Patient: I mean, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired. I just have no energy.
Therapist: So you sleep a lot. But even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested.
Patient: No, not at all.
Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.
Patient: No. I just have no energy. I don't want to do anything but just sleep.
Therapist: How long has that been going on?
Patient: I guess a couple months.
Therapist: Two or three months?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What else is going on?
Patient: Well, you know, I been drinking more. I mean, I drink socially. But I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep.
Therapist: And that's where its increased?
Patient: It is Because I don't usually drink that often during the week. So it's increased. Yeah.
Therapist: And I can see where that would be bothersome to you. What else? What else is going on with you?
Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago. So Mother's Day is coming up so you don't have to think about mama law. I miss her a lot.
Therapist: And anniversaries is close?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: That's particularly hard. When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. that's a that's a very difficult time.
Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: Exercises is again in a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.
Patient: Okay. I didn't know that.
Therapist: Yeah, it actually raises serotonin You heard about serotonin.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Happy hormone. Yes. So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is, but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself. So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly in and actually improving the quality of sleep. How does that sound at this point?
Patient: Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to be on the medication Right now we can try that.
Therapist: Absolutely. Again, those are yours, your decisions and I'm, I'm here to really support you in those if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm, I'm all for it.
Patient: I'll try them on the medication. I have some friends exercise and workout I could probably call and exercise with them.
Therapist: So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program? Yeah. Is this something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?
Patient: Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym. I have some friends that walk after work.
Therapist: So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Which of those tend to interest you most?
Patient: Well, and then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes, too. So, yeah, but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it, but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away.
Therapist: Very good. Well, I think it sounds like this is an important for you to feel better. And it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan. How do you see this fitting into your Life at this pointagain, kind of getting back to the counseling and, and the exercise.
Patient: Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work. So I can call her and see if I could still see her after work for therapy, and exercise. And I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends, my friends, they exercise various time. So, yeah.
Therapist: Let's talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program. Zero being not very competent at all and 10 being very confident. Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.
Patient: Honestly, maybe five and I'll try it. Anything if if I have to do that, so I have to go on medication, then I'll try it. Okay.
Therapist: That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.
Patient: Yes, I'll try it.
Therapist: Okay. And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point, then.
Patient: Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but you know, I'm just sleeping all the time. So when they call I'm sleep, so I haven't really call them back. But I, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know, I'll want to meet up with them. And, you know, at least maybe just start walking.
Therapist: I think that's a great decision. You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call.
Patient: Yeah, have real close, close friends that lives not too far from me. Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise.
Patient: Well, I probably shouldn't come home. I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her.
Therapist: So it would be difficult to do it in the morning. You don't see that happening
Patient: No, because it's so hard when I get up in the air. I'm so tired that I can't. I can't say do it in the morning.
Therapist: Do you think it would be easier to do it after work?
Patient: Because I'm already out Yeah, as long as I don't come home, come home I just Want to go to sleep
Therapist: come home its over?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Yeah, yeah.","Therapist: All right. Well, good. It sounds like we have a plan for the counselor. And when you check out today, I'll put this in your record.

Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: Exercises is again in a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.
Patient: Okay. I didn't know that.
Therapist: Yeah, it actually raises serotonin You heard about serotonin.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Happy hormone. Yes. So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is, but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself. So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly in and actually improving the quality of sleep. How does that sound at this point?
Patient: Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to be on the medication Right now we can try that.
Therapist: Absolutely. Again, those are yours, your decisions and I'm, I'm here to really support you in those if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm, I'm all for it.
Patient: I'll try them on the medication. I have some friends exercise and workout I could probably call and exercise with them.
Therapist: So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program? Yeah. Is this something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?
Patient: Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym. I have some friends that walk after work.
Therapist: So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Which of those tend to interest you most?
Patient: Well, and then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes, too. So, yeah, but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it, but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away.
Therapist: Very good. Well, I think it sounds like this is an important for you to feel better. And it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan. How do you see this fitting into your Life at this pointagain, kind of getting back to the counseling and, and the exercise.
Patient: Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work. So I can call her and see if I could still see her after work for therapy, and exercise. And I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends, my friends, they exercise various time. So, yeah.
Therapist: Let's talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program. Zero being not very competent at all and 10 being very confident. Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.
Patient: Honestly, maybe five and I'll try it. Anything if if I have to do that, so I have to go on medication, then I'll try it. Okay.
Therapist: That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.
Patient: Yes, I'll try it.
Therapist: Okay. And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point, then.
Patient: Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but you know, I'm just sleeping all the time. So when they call I'm sleep, so I haven't really call them back. But I, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know, I'll want to meet up with them. And, you know, at least maybe just start walking.
Therapist: I think that's a great decision. You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call.
Patient: Yeah, have real close, close friends that lives not too far from me. Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise.
Patient: Well, I probably shouldn't come home. I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her.
Therapist: So it would be difficult to do it in the morning. You don't see that happening
Patient: No, because it's so hard when I get up in the air. I'm so tired that I can't. I can't say do it in the morning.
Therapist: Do you think it would be easier to do it after work?
Patient: Because I'm already out Yeah, as long as I don't come home, come home I just Want to go to sleep
Therapist: come home its over?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Yeah, yeah.",Therapist: But after work it's still hard,Therapy-DLDLM
test,HOPE,2,24,Therapist,"Therapist: Elizabeth, how you doing today?
Patient: Um All right.
Therapist: How things been going since the last time we met?
Patient: it's about the same. I'm still feeling pretty down. I mean, I just feel really stuck and not happy and I just don't know why.
Therapist: Okay, so there's a few things going on there. You said you feeling stuck? Not happy. And some sound like a little confused as to what's going on what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing?
Patient: I mean, I've been feeling like really isolated lately. You know, because I'm a stay at home mom. It's hard. There's not a lot of people. You know, right at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, so I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships just kind of fizzled out. And I ever since then it's just like, I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone.
Therapist: And how long have you been? You say housewife, right? How long, you've been the housewife?
Patient: For a long time, I have two boys. They're eight and 10 and I've been staying home since my first one was born. So 10 years and you know, it's it's been really rewarding for me I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything like that. Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for so long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's some thing inside of me.
Therapist: something's changed. So for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life. And somewhere along the line, something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it. So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping? No, that's what changed.
Patient: Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight. So he's only been in school for a couple of years. So I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. So it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's just not really happening anymore. So now I kind of feel like it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.
Therapist: So you're, you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit.
Patient: Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know That I would feel better if I, you know, maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don't want to at the same time, so I'm frustrated with myself because I know I kind of know what would help but then I don't really have the like the volition to do it.
Therapist: You're not motivated?
Patient: Yeah,I'm not motivated.
Therapist: Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning? Has anyone else noticed that you're down?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same. But you know, he works. And then he has to come home and pick up my slack. So he's getting frustrated, which I understand. And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I'm not doing as much and so it kind of hurts. It feels like everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and then I'm not doing enough and it's always that like feeling, you know, like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less, I feel like they're all right. You know, I am lazy. I'm not doing anything
Therapist: they used the word lazy.
Patient: No, no, not that I can remember. I, you know, I think my mom said, like, you're not doing as much as you used to and I kind of took offense to that, even though it's kind of true. It's like, I don't know. It hurt.
Therapist: Okay, that was painful for you. What about what your husband said?
Patient: You know, I think at first we didn't really acknowledge it. It was like, you know, I took a break here. He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it's been and more he's kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I'm not motivated, it's still frustrating because I, it's my responsibility. So I think he's, you know, he's been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more.
Therapist: What was your response to that? When I said, I need you to more?
Patient: I started crying because I know he's right and that's what I tell myself every day, I need to do more, but I don't have the motivation to do it. And so I'm so frustrated with myself. And, you know, I know that he needs that from me and I don't know why I'm not motivated to do it.

test,HOPE,5,44,Therapist,"Therapist: Afternoon. I'm glad you could get in today.
Patient: I'm still anxious.
Therapist: Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went?
Patient: Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, so I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that.
Therapist: Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.
Patient: Yeah, I don't. I don't really like to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in.
Therapist: So it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?
Patient: It just makes me feel a little bit nervous. And then when I get out there, I don't really, I don't really engage in conversation.
Therapist: Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.
Patient: I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.
Therapist: That would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around.
Patient: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Therapist: And in terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.
Patient: Well, I just looked at my gym. I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying To go to a gym, and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else. So that's why I didn't really look anywhere else.
Therapist: Mm hmm. And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10?
Patient: Maybe about a five or six.
Therapist: Okay.
Patient: Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it. So I'm interested in doing it, it's just really hard.
Therapist: So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging.
Patient: Well, I haven't done it before. So it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people?
Therapist: Mm hmm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility?
Patient: Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible.
Therapist: Mm hmm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: And you'd be a beginner?
Patient: Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class.
Therapist: Okay. So what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?
Patient: Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.
Therapist: Okay. So you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class
Patient: I think I feel really good.
Therapist: And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?
Patient: Right? I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.
Therapist: What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?
Patient: The causes are not we're not sure. Okay.
Therapist: I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?
Patient: Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. So as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility
Therapist: and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?
Patient: I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling.
Therapist: What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?
Patient: Well, I probably feel really good in the end.
Therapist: You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.
Patient: I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits.
Therapist: Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?
Patient: Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.","Therapist: Good, good.

Therapist: and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?
Patient: I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling.
Therapist: What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?
Patient: Well, I probably feel really good in the end.
Therapist: You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.
Patient: I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits.
Therapist: Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?
Patient: Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.

Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing

Therapist: I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you had some symptoms recently they've been bothering you.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Could you tell me about those?
Patient: Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it's killing me. I can't do it anymore.
Therapist: Tell me about how these presentations are set up.
Patient: So it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. Five minutes or so maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basically
Therapist: and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you.
Patient: Yeah,
Therapist: would feeling so you have
Patient: I feel like it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And so it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm so anxious and so nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I just can't. I just can't.
Therapist: So, so this is this is distressing for you.
Therapist: And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then?
Patient: By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel like my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel like everybody can hear it. My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering, I just can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel like it's still a mess.
Therapist: You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages. So we talked about the very beginning. So you're already having anxieties sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.
Patient: Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. So there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go.
Therapist: So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation.
Patient: I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything. So everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I've I feel like I've disappointed him and I've so I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever.
Therapist: See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people.
Patient: Um, well if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't like to go to new places.

Patient: Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.
Patient: Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think
Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient: Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just
Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.
Therapist: Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient: Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time
Therapist: this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.
Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist: So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient: Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient: Well, I think
Patient: over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient: punched in the gut.
Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient: I'd be able to do that I
Patient: think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of
Patient: talking with her.
Patient: maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,
Patient: and then go from there.
Therapist: So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.
Patient: Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.","Therapist: You don't want them to have to come and sort that out.

Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.
Therapist: Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient: Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time
Therapist: this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.
Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist: So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient: Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient: Well, I think
Patient: over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient: punched in the gut.
Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient: I'd be able to do that I
Patient: think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of
Patient: talking with her.
Patient: maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,
Patient: and then go from there.
Therapist: So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.
Patient: Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.

Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist: So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient: Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient: Well, I think
Patient: over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient: punched in the gut.
Patient: And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient: I'd be able to do that I
Patient: think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of
Patient: talking with her.
Patient: maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,
Patient: and then go from there.
Therapist: So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.
Patient: Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.
Therapist: You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week?
Patient: I will definitely try.
Therapist: So really our plan move forward as a couple parts. So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?
Patient: Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you.",Therapist: So I'll see you next Tuesday.,DLDLM
test,HOPE,38,75,Therapist,"Therapist: Alisa How you doing today?
Patient: Good? How are you?
Therapist: I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist: How has the anxiety been going?
Patient: Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.
Patient: Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think
Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient: Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just
Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.
Therapist: Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient: Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time
Therapist: this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.
Therapist: So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient: Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.

Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient: I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore.
Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist: So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: You don't know ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient: Yes. Yes.

Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,
Therapist: if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.

Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing

Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.
Therapist: What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient: I don't have one.
Therapist: You don't have one ?
Patient: No, no.
Therapist: before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.

Therapist: can't worry anymore ?
Patient: Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.

Patient: There is no alternative.
Therapist: So what do you do?
Patient: I don't know.

Patient: Yeah
Therapist: I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?

Therapist: Like, markedly so.
Patient: Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn.
Therapist: Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient: I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist: Got in done order for what?
Patient: like if I died,

Patient: I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist: Would your family miss you?
Patient: I don't really care.
Therapist: Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient: Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.

Therapist: Good changes ?
Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it.

Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down.

I take a test, I mean I know lot of information and I sit down and take the test and it's like I can't I can't recall because I'm so anxious about this test even though there
Therapist: was anything physical thought there?
Patient: Yeah, I think it's a lot of thoughts in my head and it is very physical. I mean, I get sweaty, I get sweaty palms, my heart starts racing, you know, I get tense. So it's it is physical. so Yeah,
Therapist: Do you remember what thoughts going on?
Patient: Um, my thoughts are like, I'm in the car. I'm gonna get hit. If I'm taking a test, it's like, Okay, I gotta do well on this test. I gotta remember this, there's so much to remember, and I just kind of brings freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. So I guess. So have you found that? No problem, which was not being able to complete the task?
Therapist: Four is it worth once you go through?
Patient: Um, is it like anxiety over when I finished the test? Yeah, yeah, after I'm finished. I mean, I know I could do perform better if I was going because I knew it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. Um, it seems to me like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, maybe it's over. You know, I'm anxious during it but when it's over. Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down.
Therapist: So sounds like you might need to find something that helps.
Patient: Yeah, I also think that the time, tell me in the moment because these are things that I mean, I can't avoid. I mean, even in my job to I've got to go my field placement. I've got to do these group settings, you know, I've got to do, and kids are crazy. They're disrespectful, like, Okay, I got to do it, though. So all these things I have to do. I can't change them and my wife right now, so got to figure out how to deal with it better.
Therapist: Would you like to describe that?
Patient: yeah, I'm very eager to learn something that can make a difference.
Therapist: Well, there's something called grounding do you know?
Patient: No just lectricity grounding, you know that third floor thing, that's only grounding I know. I need to be grounded. That sounds good. Bring it on
Therapist: So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place. So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem like there's still traffic. Yeah, nothing's going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal with
Patient: That sounds good.
Therapist: So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses. Okay, so I have a little script. Okay
Patient: okay. Okay.
Therapist: They'll tell me after. I'd be like, okay,
Patient: okay, okay.

Therapist: You all right?
Patient: I'm just here.
Therapist: You're just here, just here. I understand that you're in the hospital a couple weeks ago.
Patient: Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.
Therapist: What happened?
Patient: yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get
Therapist: what you think the government is trying to do.
Patient: They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.
Therapist: And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.
Patient: So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.
Therapist: Is that how you were feeling when you were building?
Patient: Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.
Therapist: That's what you're trying to do
Patient: Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.

Patient: I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.
Therapist: So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much

Therapist: Is that on your mind now?
Patient: No, that we're talking about it? Yes.

Patient: I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
Therapist: Okay. Can you tell me about any disorders you've been diagnosed with?

Therapist: But How about now?
Patient: How about now I'm having problems with anxiety ?
Therapist: Hmm
Patient: Umm not as bad as in the past.
Therapist: How is depression?
Patient: Yeah,
Therapist: right now ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: And how bad?
Patient: pretty bad.
Therapist: Yeah. On a scale of one to 10 with 10 being the worst it's ever been. How depressed you're now ?
Patient: Probably Like an eight or nine,
Therapist: Eight or Nine that's depressed ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: How about anxiety at the same scale?
Patient: Probably like a four or five.
Therapist: You're fine. So not quite as bad as its been ?
Patient: No, not as bad as it's been, but it's getting up there.
Therapist: Yeah, it's getting worse lately.
Patient: Yeah, I think yeah, it's been worse lately. Yeah.
Therapist: So if you'r think back, say a couple days ago. How bad was the anxiety and depression?
Patient: anxiety probably like a three or four. Depression about an eight or nine still same.
Therapist: same intensity?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Alright, Do you have any medical illnesses?
Patient: Um, no.
Therapist: Do you live alone?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you do ?
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: How often you see your relatives?
Patient: probably see my relatives like every, like, maybe once a month, maybe
Therapist: once a month, how about friends ?
Patient: friends, it depends. Not as much lately, I used to be better friends with my coworkers and I lost my job. So I haven't seen them as much. And so probably maybe like once a week, maybe once a week depends on the week.
Therapist: How long ago you lost your job?
Patient: Umm about two months ago,
Therapist: two months ago,
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that happens to you. how would you characterize the strength of your social network? Like, is it as strong as you want it to be?
Patient: No, sometimes I feel pretty alone. Yeah, I feel like you know, nobody really wants me around. Nobody really needs me. So yeah. I feel pretty alone a lot of time. Sometimes even when I'm with other people,
Therapist: so you're with people when you still feel isolated.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you are with people when you're not feeling isolated, how would you characterize the quality of the relationships you have? Let's start with your family. How good do you think those relationships are?
Patient: I mean, they're okay. Like not really that great. But everybody has like, trouble with their family. I guess so. I don't know.
Therapist: You think its more or less normal?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: How is it with your friends?
Patient: It's okay. You know, I guess I'm always like, second guessing everything. Like, do they really like me? Do they really want to spend time with me? I know I'm bothering them. That kind of thing. But I mean, it's not for the most part. I mean, I think they care about me. It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time. I think When we're together for the most part but
Therapist: most part positive ?
Patient: yeah
Therapist: Do you have any conflict or crisis going on right now? You mentioned the loss of your job.
Patient: Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna be evicted from my house or you know, my apartment because I can't pay my bills because I lost my job so I really don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to go. I just don't know what to do. I'm feeling really lost and like helpless and like everything's just pointless.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. When are you going to be evicted?
Patient: Um, well, I'm not quite sure. Um, it sounds like it's going to be at the end of the month.
Therapist: So then month are going to be evicted from the is it house or apartment ?
Patient: Its an apartment
Therapist: when did you find this out?
Patient: Um, well, you know, before I lost my job, I had some trouble paying the rent as it was. So, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like, a month and a half ago, my landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore, but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in Then and Now, at the beginning of the month, he said, you know, you have to, you're gonna have to get out of here, you're gonna be evicted. We're gonna change the locks. And
Therapist: so it's all fairly recent.
Patient: Yeah. I guess that's why having more anxiety than before because like, it feels really out of control, and I don't know what is going to happen like when he's going to do it, you know, for sure and how you know what I'm going to do. So
Therapist: there's a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen and what's going to happen to you?
Patient: Exactly
Therapist: hmmm.. . have you in the past thought about suicide?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: Can you tell me about how many times or about how often ?
Patient: Umm probably like, every time I get depressed like this, I, I, you know, have those thoughts. So I don't know. I mean, how often? That's that's a really hard question.
Therapist: All right. Have you ever attempted to commit suicide?
Patient: Yeah, one time, probably like four years ago.
Therapist: What did you do?
Patient: I cut my wrists, but it wasn't, you know, nothing really happened. Like I just put a I just wrapped him up. It wasn't really that bad
Therapist: You didn't need to go to hospital
Patient: No
Therapist: Have you ever thought about committing suicide and we're about to attempt and stopped ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: How many times does that happen?
Patient: Umm maybe like three or four. It's hard to remember cuz sometimes is a long time ago but more recently like maybe once or twice at least.
Therapist: So once or twice in the recent past ?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Have you ever injured yourself intentionally?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay, can you tell me about that.
Patient: Well, there was that time that I tried to commit suicide and then there have been times before that where I like, you know, kind of like tested the waters like, you know, just cut myself a little bit to see what it would be like and that kind of thing.
Therapist: was the last time You have done that ?
Patient: Um, it would be the last time I tried to commit suicide like that with time I was telling you about that really freaked me out. So I don't think I would try that again.
Therapist: so you don't think you'd try that again.
Patient: No Not like cutting myself up.
Therapist: Okay. Have you ever been abused, physically, sexually, emotionally?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: So if you get evicted, you're worried you'd have to live with your mother.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: And you guys had a rough time in the past.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: You don't want to repeat that.
Patient: No, I don't wanna live like that
Therapist: What is your attitude towards suicide? What are your feelings about suicide as a concept in general?
Patient: I don't know. I mean, I guess it's really sad like, nobody wants that. You know, whenever you hear somebody committed suicide, everybody's really sad about it, but sometimes it just feels like what else is there? You know, like, I don't know how I can go on like this, like things just keep getting worse and worse. And I don't know what to do. So I mean, I'm sure. Like, it's not a great thing, but at the same time, I don't know.
Therapist: You disapprove it, But you're considering it because you're running out of options.

Therapist: when did you find this out?
Patient: Um, well, you know, before I lost my job, I had some trouble paying the rent as it was. So, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like, a month and a half ago, my landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore, but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in Then and Now, at the beginning of the month, he said, you know, you have to, you're gonna have to get out of here, you're gonna be evicted. We're gonna change the locks. And

You know, like, I don't know how I can go on like this, like things just keep getting worse and worse. And I don't know what to do. So I mean, I'm sure. Like, it's not a great thing, but at the same time, I don't know.

Patient: even if it was her fault that the lights weren't on and there were no there was no water. It would somehow be my fault. No while you're, I had to bail your sister out again. So you know this happened and I had to drive around town to find your sister because you know, she was just off doing her own thing. So I spent all the money on gas couldn't pay them like that was always my fault. Everything was always my fault, even though I knew it wasn't but still harbor.
Therapist: That was painful for you.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Do you think that had an impact or that or the physical abuse had an impact on your life? What's happening now?
Patient: physical abuse, I guess I try to end fights with violence, I guess, because I know how bad it can get. So I've tried to shut it down really fast, but probably not the most healthiest way. What's been the honest, that's why I think my sister and me are close. And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat. And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that's the bad sister.

Therapist: So occasionally you'll borrow money.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: All right. How about your sleep? Do you feel like you sleep as much as you should? More than you should or less than you're sure
Patient: much less than I should.

Therapist: How about food intake eating? Do you feel like you eat more than you should less than you should or about right?
Patient: More than I should more, I find myself like snacking a lot during the day. And I'll still have regular meal. So it's like meals on top of snacking on top of meals on top of snack and it's just a lot of food.

Patient: My mom always tried to make me like I was the scapegoat a lot
Therapist: about that,
Patient: even if it was her fault that the lights weren't on and there were no there was no water. It would somehow be my fault. No while you're, I had to bail your sister out again. So you know this happened and I had to drive around town to find your sister because you know, she was just off doing her own thing. So I spent all the money on gas couldn't pay them like that was always my fault. Everything was always my fault, even though I knew it wasn't but still harbor.
Therapist: That was painful for you.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Do you think that had an impact or that or the physical abuse had an impact on your life? What's happening now?
Patient: physical abuse, I guess I try to end fights with violence, I guess, because I know how bad it can get. So I've tried to shut it down really fast, but probably not the most healthiest way. What's been the honest, that's why I think my sister and me are close. And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat. And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that's the bad sister.
Therapist: So you think your mother's behavior led to the way your sister treats you now?
Patient: Yeah.

Therapist: How do you think those spiritual values influence your daily life?

Patient: Uhh Not really.
Therapist: Not really.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of changes ?
Patient: You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So,
Therapist: so there's been consequences from those in your job.
Patient: Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's, you know, you have a job. So you can take care of certain things. So, yeah,
Therapist: like what things ?
Patient: like you know like paying your bills and that's pretty much it. I guess that's really why most people have a job.
Therapist: See, you've been unable to pay your bills.
Patient: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist: How's your mood overall?
Patient: I mean, what can I say I lost my job. I'm seeing you because I have a drinking problem. So things are not that great.
Therapist: Things are not great ?
Patient: No.
Therapist: Tell me what the drinking now has been gone.
Patient: I drink a lot.
Therapist: Ummm
Patient: I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of like what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist: You're drinking more ?
Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist: a lot more ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so
Therapist: cuz now you don't have a job
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient: I don't know.
Therapist: are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient: At this point, it's kind of like who cares? Like what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist: Sure in different tours.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient: Nothing really feels good.
Therapist: Just gets back to normal.
Patient: Yeah, pretty much
Therapist: When was the last time you drank ?
Patient: this morning
Therapist: How much?
Patient: A lot, I don't know.
Therapist: You don't recall.
Patient: No
Therapist: Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient: I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist: what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more.
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ?
Patient: I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know
Therapist: So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient: I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer.
Therapist: So the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient: No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist: feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist: So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient: That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist: How would you like to feel bad ?
Patient: I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist: So you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient: Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist: So, what do you see as your options right now?
Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.
Patient: sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist: Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient: No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist: So you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient: hmmm
Therapist: And when are you losing your house?
Patient: I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon.

Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

Patient: I don't know
Therapist: You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days.

test,HOPE,8,36,Therapist,"Therapist: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Patient: Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist: Hmm umm
Patient: Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist: Ahmm
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: Alright.
Patient: So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist: Uhh hmm
Patient: So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence
Patient: right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist: Ahhh hmmm.
Patient: Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.
Therapist: It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
Patient: I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.
Therapist: So, it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed.
Patient: Exactly.
Therapist: Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing so well in school, maybe any other things ?
Patient: Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So that that's also changed.
Therapist: So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now
Patient: a little bit because not all of them are into that. So like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist: hmm hmm.
Patient: So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.
Therapist: Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Patient: Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.
Therapist: Yeah
Patient: I understand that. situations like this will happen. It's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.
Therapist: Umm
Patient: That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing.
Therapist: Your mom is really important to you ?
Patient: of course,
Therapist: how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit?
Patient: I'm pretty confident
Therapist: especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?

Patient: It's okay. You know, I guess I'm always like, second guessing everything. Like, do they really like me? Do they really want to spend time with me? I know I'm bothering them. That kind of thing. But I mean, it's not for the most part. I mean, I think they care about me. It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time. I think When we're together for the most part but

Patient: Yes, thank you.
Therapist: How are you today?
Patient: I'm feeling really tired and been having this breathlessness you've really been worried about.
Therapist: You came in to see one of my colleagues recently didn't you.
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: And she sent you for a blood test.
Patient: That's right, doctor.
Therapist: Yeah, we think he might be anemic.
Patient: Oh gosh. Yes.
Therapist: What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.
Patient: So right up to dear.
Therapist: Does that sound okay with you?
Patient: That sounds fine. Yes, doctor.
Therapist: Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11 . 5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8 . 7.
Patient: All that slows.
Therapist: It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.
Patient: Right.
Therapist: And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, so it's just just getting me down doctor.
Therapist: I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.
Patient: Yes, yeah. And I just can't cope with it.
Therapist: Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition?
Patient: I don't know. I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is.
Therapist: It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.
Patient: Yeah, definitely. Yes.
Therapist: One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?
Patient: Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.
Therapist: Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?
Patient: So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes
Therapist: teenage children they keep you busy.
Patient: Oh they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired. I'm just getting tired
Therapist: It must be hard for you to do all those things.
Patient: Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore.
Therapist: yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.
Patient: All right doctor
Therapist: So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.
Patient: Oh, right. Okay.
Therapist: Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.
Patient: No No
Therapist: You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.
Patient: Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day.
Therapist: Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron.
Patient: No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver.
Therapist: What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?
Patient: Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah.
Therapist: There's also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron.
Patient: Ohh the kids wouldn't eat that. But, I mean, they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and I could go for the leafy green vegetables. Broccoli, so there's broccoli?
Therapist: Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know,
Patient: Ohh good, good I would go with that.
Therapist: There's other things too. You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. And
Patient: what are those?
Therapist: Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those.
Patient: Oh, yes, yes, ill Look in the supermarket. I mean, I've got some of those. We could have a tweak and and that gives me more time to cook or die
Therapist: could make your life a bit easier.
Patient: Yeah, definitely I would be happy to vote yes,
Therapist: white bread is a good source of iron as well.
Patient: Yes. Yeah. No, they only like white bread only buy white bread, but I could buy myself some brown bread. cobs and have it for lunch. Yes. Yeah. No good.
Therapist: So do you think you could give some of those things a try?
Patient: Yeah. I would try doctor definitely
Therapist: right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.
Patient: Oh, I'm not into tablets. Why?
Therapist: Okay. This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia. And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you're getting in your diet.
Patient: So will that be short term,
Therapist: yes, yes. Often people respond very well to those. You can have some side effects. Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach. So Do you take them after a meal?
Patient: All right you how to remember to do that? Yes. Yeah.
Therapist: I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets, I think he might respond very well to treatment.
Patient: Yes. Yeah. Have a go. Doctor
Therapist: how do you feel about the information I've given you so far outside?
Patient: Yes, I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better. It's worth it.
Therapist: ...","Patient: Yes, I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better. It's worth it.","Therapist: Yes. Excellent. Yeah, excellent.

And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.
Patient: Yeah, definitely. Yes.
Therapist: One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?
Patient: Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.
Therapist: Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?
Patient: So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes
Therapist: teenage children they keep you busy.
Patient: Oh they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired. I'm just getting tired
Therapist: It must be hard for you to do all those things.
Patient: Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore.
Therapist: yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.
Patient: All right doctor
Therapist: So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.
Patient: Oh, right. Okay.
Therapist: Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.
Patient: No No
Therapist: You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.
Patient: Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day.
Therapist: Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron.
Patient: No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver.
Therapist: What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?
Patient: Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah.
Therapist: There's also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron.
Patient: Ohh the kids wouldn't eat that. But, I mean, they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and I could go for the leafy green vegetables. Broccoli, so there's broccoli?
Therapist: Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know,
Patient: Ohh good, good I would go with that.
Therapist: There's other things too. You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. And
Patient: what are those?
Therapist: Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those.
Patient: Oh, yes, yes, ill Look in the supermarket. I mean, I've got some of those. We could have a tweak and and that gives me more time to cook or die
Therapist: could make your life a bit easier.
Patient: Yeah, definitely I would be happy to vote yes,
Therapist: white bread is a good source of iron as well.
Patient: Yes. Yeah. No, they only like white bread only buy white bread, but I could buy myself some brown bread. cobs and have it for lunch. Yes. Yeah. No good.
Therapist: So do you think you could give some of those things a try?
Patient: Yeah. I would try doctor definitely
Therapist: right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.
Patient: Oh, I'm not into tablets. Why?
Therapist: Okay. This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia. And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you're getting in your diet.
Patient: So will that be short term,
Therapist: yes, yes. Often people respond very well to those. You can have some side effects. Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach. So Do you take them after a meal?
Patient: All right you how to remember to do that? Yes. Yeah.
Therapist: I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets, I think he might respond very well to treatment.
Patient: Yes. Yeah. Have a go. Doctor
Therapist: how do you feel about the information I've given you so far outside?
Patient: Yes, I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better. It's worth it.

Therapist: You came in to see one of my colleagues recently didn't you.
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: And she sent you for a blood test.
Patient: That's right, doctor.
Therapist: Yeah, we think he might be anemic.
Patient: Oh gosh. Yes.
Therapist: What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.
Patient: So right up to dear.
Therapist: Does that sound okay with you?
Patient: That sounds fine. Yes, doctor.
Therapist: Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11 . 5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8 . 7.
Patient: All that slows.
Therapist: It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.
Patient: Right.
Therapist: And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, so it's just just getting me down doctor.
Therapist: I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.
Patient: Yes, yeah. And I just can't cope with it.

Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.

Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist: So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient: I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.

Patient: Good? How are you?
Therapist: I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist: How has the anxiety been going?
Patient: Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.
Patient: Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think
Patient: I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist: I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient: So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient: no.
Therapist: So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient: Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just
Therapist: other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient: I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient: I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient: it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist: at the time when you were?
Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist: So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,
Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient: So I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist: Was this criticism?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist: That's a feeling
Patient: I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient: being upset and like disrespected and again yeah
Therapist: was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist: Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right.

Therapist: Yeah. Well, it sounds like there's some judgments in there. Right. So it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like, I'm feeling really bad.
Patient: Yeah, yeah
Therapist: that sort of thing. But you did say it more descriptively which is great, which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now.
Patient: Right, Just eating not makes me feel icky. I don't know. Just
Therapist: Yeah. And I can totally understand how you get to there. If you're thinking, I'm feeling fat. I'm going to get fat. You know, it's an easy place to get to. Okay.

Therapist: Sure. So what what emotion do you think that is?
Patient: Being afraid being a fearful of what will happen if I eat that?
Therapist: I think that's exactly right. That's what I'm seeing. You know, I see you kind of crawled up over there. You know, you have a very worried faced, you know, and you're having a hard time approaching it. I think I think that's absolutely right, that you're feeling fear. And I want you to know, that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake.
Patient: I honestly I can't remember. I don't know.
Therapist: I know it's been it's been a really long time. you certainly didn't need it all through, you know, when you were really stuck in your eating disorder, you know,
Patient: I used to, I used to like it. I remember that, but it was such a long time ago.
Therapist: I know And so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear.

Patient: That's it looks like to me
Therapist: that's what. what! what is that? It's a big blob of fat.
Patient: A judgement?
Therapist: Yeah, exactly. You know, I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that. All right. Okay. So, because that's just not going to be helpful right now. So what I'm wondering is Since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with, maybe we can do some opposite action to that emotion. Do you remember what I mean by opposite action?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: What do I mean?
Patient: Instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this, and just, you know, check out basically, you want me to go towards it, and, you know, just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it.
Therapist: Right, exactly. So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door. So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that's scary, which is this cheesecake right now. Right?
Patient: Right.
Therapist: Okay. So I see how hard it is. For you and I, honestly, it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away. But as you know, the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake, it's just gonna make you more fearful The next time you come in front of some kind of food, that's tougher for you
Patient: Yeah it makes it worse.
Therapist: Yeah. So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down. Okay. So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?

Therapist: I think that's exactly right. That's what I'm seeing. You know, I see you kind of crawled up over there. You know, you have a very worried faced, you know, and you're having a hard time approaching it. I think I think that's absolutely right, that you're feeling fear. And I want you to know, that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake.
Patient: I honestly I can't remember. I don't know.
Therapist: I know it's been it's been a really long time. you certainly didn't need it all through, you know, when you were really stuck in your eating disorder, you know,
Patient: I used to, I used to like it. I remember that, but it was such a long time ago.
Therapist: I know And so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear.
Patient: Right.
Therapist: And you had said, this is one of the hardest foods for you. So that makes sense to me.
Patient: Right. I just see it like, as a big blob of fat
Therapist: right
Patient: That's it looks like to me
Therapist: that's what. what! what is that? It's a big blob of fat.
Patient: A judgement?
Therapist: Yeah, exactly. You know, I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that. All right. Okay. So, because that's just not going to be helpful right now. So what I'm wondering is Since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with, maybe we can do some opposite action to that emotion. Do you remember what I mean by opposite action?
Patient: Mm hmm.
Therapist: What do I mean?
Patient: Instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this, and just, you know, check out basically, you want me to go towards it, and, you know, just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it.
Therapist: Right, exactly. So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door. So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that's scary, which is this cheesecake right now. Right?
Patient: Right.
Therapist: Okay. So I see how hard it is. For you and I, honestly, it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away. But as you know, the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake, it's just gonna make you more fearful The next time you come in front of some kind of food, that's tougher for you
Patient: Yeah it makes it worse.
Therapist: Yeah. So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down. Okay. So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?
Patient: Okay
Therapist: All right. Okay. Let's do it. So how was that?
Patient: This is difficult
Therapist: Yeah, I can see how difficult it is.
Patient: But I'm doing it, but its difficult.
Therapist: Exactly.

Therapist: and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient: Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.
Patient: right
Patient: I mean, I guess.
Therapist: Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient: yeah.
Therapist: So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly

Patient: when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.

Patient: I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist: It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?

Patient: Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist: To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient: like confronted her,
Therapist: you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist: Does that make some some sense?
Patient: It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.

As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Patient: Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist: Hmm umm
Patient: Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist: Ahmm
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: Alright.
Patient: So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist: Uhh hmm
Patient: So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence
Patient: right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist: Ahhh hmmm.
Patient: Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.
Therapist: It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
Patient: I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.
Therapist: So, it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed.
Patient: Exactly.
Therapist: Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing so well in school, maybe any other things ?
Patient: Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So that that's also changed.
Therapist: So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now
Patient: a little bit because not all of them are into that. So like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist: hmm hmm.
Patient: So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.
Therapist: Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Patient: Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.
Therapist: Yeah
Patient: I understand that. situations like this will happen. It's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.
Therapist: Umm
Patient: That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing.
Therapist: Your mom is really important to you ?
Patient: of course,
Therapist: how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit?
Patient: I'm pretty confident
Therapist: especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?
Patient: probably like an eight or nine I'm I can't be in time because nothing's attend my field. There's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to
Therapist: Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Patient: Because I don't know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.
Therapist: Umm hmm
Patient: It's not a pleasant experience. It's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like, even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens. Like all the fun that I have, then prior to that, just it's not worth it's not worth drinking.
Therapist: Right? What do you think's a realistic goal for you then?
Patient: To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.
Therapist: Okay
Patient: Then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time, like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do. One cup is not gonna do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure
Therapist: your goals to not drink at all, or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment.

Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.
Therapist: So, it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed.
Patient: Exactly.
Therapist: Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing so well in school, maybe any other things ?
Patient: Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So that that's also changed.
Therapist: So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now
Patient: a little bit because not all of them are into that. So like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist: hmm hmm.
Patient: So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.
Therapist: Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Patient: Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.
Therapist: Yeah
Patient: I understand that. situations like this will happen. It's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.
Therapist: Umm
Patient: That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing.
Therapist: Your mom is really important to you ?
Patient: of course,
Therapist: how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit?
Patient: I'm pretty confident
Therapist: especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?
Patient: probably like an eight or nine I'm I can't be in time because nothing's attend my field. There's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to
Therapist: Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Patient: Because I don't know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.
Therapist: Umm hmm
Patient: It's not a pleasant experience. It's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like, even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens. Like all the fun that I have, then prior to that, just it's not worth it's not worth drinking.
Therapist: Right? What do you think's a realistic goal for you then?
Patient: To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.
Therapist: Okay
Patient: Then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time, like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do. One cup is not gonna do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure
Therapist: your goals to not drink at all, or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment.
Patient: Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention, but it's not. Hey, guys. It's about doing the Yeah.

test,HOPE,8,46,Therapist,"Therapist: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Patient: Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist: Hmm umm
Patient: Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist: Ahmm
Patient: Hmm
Therapist: Alright.
Patient: So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist: Uhh hmm
Patient: So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence
Patient: right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist: Ahhh hmmm.
Patient: Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.
Therapist: It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
Patient: I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself.

Patient: Yes, thank you.
Therapist: How are you today?
Patient: I'm feeling really tired and been having this breathlessness you've really been worried about.
Therapist: You came in to see one of my colleagues recently didn't you.
Patient: Yes.
Therapist: And she sent you for a blood test.
Patient: That's right, doctor.
Therapist: Yeah, we think he might be anemic.
Patient: Oh gosh. Yes.
Therapist: What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.
Patient: So right up to dear.
Therapist: Does that sound okay with you?
Patient: That sounds fine. Yes, doctor.
Therapist: Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11 . 5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8 . 7.
Patient: All that slows.
Therapist: It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.
Patient: Right.
Therapist: And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, so it's just just getting me down doctor.
Therapist: I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.
Patient: Yes, yeah. And I just can't cope with it.
Therapist: Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition?
Patient: I don't know. I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is.
Therapist: It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.
Patient: Yeah, definitely. Yes.
Therapist: One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?
Patient: Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.
Therapist: Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?
Patient: So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes
Therapist: teenage children they keep you busy.
Patient: Oh they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired. I'm just getting tired
Therapist: It must be hard for you to do all those things.
Patient: Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore.
Therapist: yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.
Patient: All right doctor
Therapist: So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.
Patient: Oh, right. Okay.
Therapist: Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.
Patient: No No
Therapist: You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.
Patient: Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day.
Therapist: Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron.
Patient: No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver.
Therapist: What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?
Patient: Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah.

Therapist: You all right?

Therapist: You're just here, just here. I understand that you're in the hospital a couple weeks ago.
Patient: Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.
Therapist: What happened?
Patient: yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get
Therapist: what you think the government is trying to do.
Patient: They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.
Therapist: And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.
Patient: So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.
Therapist: Is that how you were feeling when you were building?
Patient: Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.
Therapist: That's what you're trying to do
Patient: Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.
Therapist: They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.
Patient: I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.
Therapist: So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much
Patient: Doesn't everybody do that?
Therapist: You're also happy and felt energetic
Patient: I felt good. Like when I when I sleep I don't like when I sleep because it just feels wrong.
Therapist: And how do you feel now in comparison?
Patient: I'm alright guy. All right. Just All right, right now. The government maybe get on different medication. So just all right.
Therapist: So not happy or sad.
Patient: not sad either. It's just you In the middle
Therapist: Do you want to get back to that happiness
Patient: of course who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life. That's the reason why you need to finish machine
Therapist: Yeah. You mentioned you ordered some products online. How much did you order?
Patient: um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy. And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid so that he can also be happy all the time.
Therapist: He would have been affected by a machine.
Patient: Of course, he's the helping hand. He helped me out. He let me borrow his tools. but evidently he didn't let me borrow him this time. So just pull him out. Have another neighbor take his place.
Therapist: Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?
Patient: I don't know. When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment. I found my mom's purse and I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there. Oh my god, I can use our credit card. So I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And so I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them.
Therapist: How'd your mother respond to that?
Patient: My mom came to the hospital and was like, where are all these boxes coming from? It's like this, but I'm in my room. And she put them into my room. And then, like a week ago, she has, like, I see my credit card, and she wants to happen.
Therapist: Is that strange relationship?
Patient: No, that's just how we have a relationship generally
Therapist: you get along, okay.
Patient: we get along perfectly fine. Like that's, that's how we talk to each other. Like, we talk to each other minimally, because she's not in my room, so she's not happy. So anytime she does come into my room, it messes up the balance. So I get unhappy, and then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place.

Patient: Okay.
Therapist: You all right?
Patient: I'm just here.
Therapist: You're just here, just here. I understand that you're in the hospital a couple weeks ago.
Patient: Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.
Therapist: What happened?
Patient: yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get
Therapist: what you think the government is trying to do.
Patient: They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.
Therapist: And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.
Patient: So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.
Therapist: Is that how you were feeling when you were building?
Patient: Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.
Therapist: That's what you're trying to do
Patient: Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.
Therapist: They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.
Patient: I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.
Therapist: So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much
Patient: Doesn't everybody do that?
Therapist: You're also happy and felt energetic
Patient: I felt good. Like when I when I sleep I don't like when I sleep because it just feels wrong.
Therapist: And how do you feel now in comparison?
Patient: I'm alright guy. All right. Just All right, right now. The government maybe get on different medication. So just all right.
Therapist: So not happy or sad.
Patient: not sad either. It's just you In the middle
Therapist: Do you want to get back to that happiness
Patient: of course who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life. That's the reason why you need to finish machine
Therapist: Yeah. You mentioned you ordered some products online. How much did you order?
Patient: um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy. And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid so that he can also be happy all the time.
Therapist: He would have been affected by a machine.
Patient: Of course, he's the helping hand. He helped me out. He let me borrow his tools. but evidently he didn't let me borrow him this time. So just pull him out. Have another neighbor take his place.
Therapist: Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?
Patient: I don't know. When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment. I found my mom's purse and I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there. Oh my god, I can use our credit card. So I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And so I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them.

You know, whenever I leave my front door woman at number seven, she's always there. What you know, she's clocking where I'm going, what I'm doing.

Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph. Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive. So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine. And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range. So how does that How does that feel?
Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. I didn't know I was depressed.
Therapist: But you knew something was something was wrong.

Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.
Patient: I mean, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired. I just have no energy.
Therapist: So you sleep a lot. But even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested.
Patient: No, not at all.
Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.
Patient: No. I just have no energy. I don't want to do anything but just sleep.
Therapist: How long has that been going on?
Patient: I guess a couple months.
Therapist: Two or three months?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What else is going on?
Patient: Well, you know, I been drinking more. I mean, I drink socially. But I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep.
Therapist: And that's where its increased?
Patient: It is Because I don't usually drink that often during the week. So it's increased. Yeah.
Therapist: And I can see where that would be bothersome to you. What else? What else is going on with you?
Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago. So Mother's Day is coming up so you don't have to think about mama law. I miss her a lot.
Therapist: And anniversaries is close?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: That's particularly hard. When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. that's a that's a very difficult time.
Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
Patient: Okay.

Patient: Yeah
Therapist: you know, we did some pre visit planning with you and your Ph. Q two, which is a short depression screen was actually positive. So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a pH q nine. And that actually did come up with a score of eight, which is in mild depression range. So how does that How does that feel?
Patient: Well, I knew I felt different. I didn't know I was depressed.
Therapist: But you knew something was something was wrong.
Patient: I didn't feel like myself. I haven't been feeling like myself Now.
Therapist: Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.
Patient: I mean, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep. I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired. I just have no energy.
Therapist: So you sleep a lot. But even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested.
Patient: No, not at all.
Therapist: Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.
Patient: No. I just have no energy. I don't want to do anything but just sleep.
Therapist: How long has that been going on?
Patient: I guess a couple months.
Therapist: Two or three months?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: What else is going on?
Patient: Well, you know, I been drinking more. I mean, I drink socially. But I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep.
Therapist: And that's where its increased?
Patient: It is Because I don't usually drink that often during the week. So it's increased. Yeah.
Therapist: And I can see where that would be bothersome to you. What else? What else is going on with you?
Patient: Well, you know, my mom died a year ago. So Mother's Day is coming up so you don't have to think about mama law. I miss her a lot.
Therapist: And anniversaries is close?
Patient: Yeah.
Therapist: That's particularly hard. When those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents. that's a that's a very difficult time.
Patient: Yeah. And I took care of mom. So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer. So I took care of her So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was. So now that she's gone. It just kind of brings up everything all over again.
Therapist: Kind of a hole in your life?
Patient: Yeah, we were really close.
Therapist: I'm really sorry for your loss. And thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's, I know, that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
Patient: Yeah
Therapist: just kind of going through the motions. It sounds like during the day And then how's your appetite then?
Patient: Not really eating that much. You know, I don't have energy, you know, before I would come home cooked dinner or, you know, meet some friends after work, but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine. Just go to bed.
Therapist: So you used to be more socially involved than you aren't now.
Patient: Yeah, I don't do anything now.
Therapist: A little more isolated.
Patient: Yeah. Just working from home and sleep.
Therapist: So if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?
Patient: Well, I don't want to stay like this. This isn't who I am. You know, just sleeping all the time. It's just, I don't want to stay this way.
Therapist: kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.
Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or Go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep. I don't want to do that. It's kind of the same old routine.
Therapist: I wonder if it would be okay, if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression like you would that be right?
Patient: Hmmm
Therapist: Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer. So, no medication at this point.
Patient: No.
Therapist: All right. Then, I think as important, certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling, and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and, and getting some feedback on that.
Patient: I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,
Therapist: so that was a pretty good experience?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.
Therapist: Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate. And those that some it's another thing that we could talk about if you want to learn a little bit more about those.
Patient: Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.
Therapist: Okay. If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute. And then we can hit some of those Other things, too.
Patient: Okay.
Therapist: So is there a counselor that you know, or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death? Is she someone that's out in the community?
Patient: She was really nice. Yeah. I liked her.
Therapist: So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that. Could you say on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being really ready, zero being not ready at all. How ready would you be to do some counseling?
Patient: Maybe like a six or seven
Therapist: Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?
Patient: Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back
Therapist: So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again yeah.
Therapist: Well, that's okay. Then it would it be alright, if we talked a little bit about the exercise? I know you. So that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine. Only you can make those decisions Alvina. But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.
