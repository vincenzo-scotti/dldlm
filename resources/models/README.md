# Models

This directory is used to host the pre-trained model directories.
These directories contain both models and tokenisers trained during the experiments.
It is possible to download a zip archive with all the trained models and tokenisers at [this link](https://polimi365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/10451445_polimi_it/ESuBW6NcQZtLuvxiQVc9PhwBXn-H2K22oi2Z4F1Q_a9ajA?e=72vhXB).

Pre-trained models are also available through the *HuggingFace*'s [*Model Hub*](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=dldlm).
